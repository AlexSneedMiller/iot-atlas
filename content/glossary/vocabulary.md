### Actuator
> an actuator is used to move or control a mechanism in the environment

### Command Message
> a [message](#message) describing an action that should be taken and that the device knows should be acknowledged on another topic once the action is complete.

### Device
> an entity that has enough power and compute resources to be a part of an IoT solution. Most often devices have [sensor](#sensor)s or [actuator](#actuator)s attached. 

### Device Data Density
> a device's data density is: `density = sample frequency * sample size * reporting frequency`

### Endpoint
> an endpoint is ...tbd

### Limited Production
> tbd

### Message
> a unit of communication in an IoT solution, often containing either sensed or command-related data

### Message Broker
> a component of an IoT solution responsible for managing message routing between authorized publishers and subscribers of topics.

### Message Topic
> a message topic, aka. *topic*, is a subject associated with a message. Topics are often used for the routing of messages from publishers to subscribers. In this context a message topic should be thought of as a direct map to the pub/sub concept of a subject and as a similar concept to the partial URLs used to describe request/response and REST endpoints.

### Ordered Store
> a data store or micro-service which fulfills the role in an IoT solution of ensuring that all records stored within it are in time-series order.

### Pilot
> tbd

### Production
> tbd

### Prototype
> tbd

### Rule
> tbd

### Rule Engine
> tbd

### Sensor
> a sensor is used to measure some aspect of the environment around it
